Things to consider:
1. input shape
for one program, the shape is [iter # x var #], usually [1000 x 6].
It should be treated as a setence of 6 words. Each word has a dimension of 1000 elements

2. output classifiers
(1) If we use N output queries, then for the final output, there will be N items. From each item we will predict an equation/inequality.
We need to use a classifier, with the options: x, x^2, xy, x^3, x^2*y, (x mod 2)

3. op_idx: a mapping from the op(x, x2, x3, ...) to its numbering. Currently the size is 6. It is defined in this file: ./datasets/invar_spec.py

4. output shapes:
(1) eq: [batch_size, num_queries, eq_type_num], "num_queries" is the number for the limit of possible equations/inequalities in this data point. "eq_type_num" is the number of types for eq. The number is 2+1(no-object)
(2) op: [batch_size, num_queries, op_type_num], "op_type_num" is the same as the length of op_idx. Currently the value is 6
